Secret Santa Assignment
This project automates the Secret Santa event by assigning a secret child to each employee while following certain constraints.

** Problem Statement**
A company is organizing a Secret Santa event. Employees should be assigned a secret child while ensuring:

An employee cannot be assigned to themselves.
An employee should not receive the same secret child as last year.
Each employee must have exactly one secret child.
Each child should be assigned to only one employee.
This program reads employee data from a CSV file, assigns secret children, and outputs the assignments in another CSV file.
